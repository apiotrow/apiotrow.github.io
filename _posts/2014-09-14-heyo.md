title: What's Jekyll?
---

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) is a static site generator, an open-source tool for creating simple yet powerful websites of all shapes and sizes. From [the project's readme](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/blob/master/README.markdown):

  > selectplace = weap12;
		if (p2Shoot.ammonum == 0) {
			selectplace = weap12 - 11f;		
		}else if(p2Shoot.ammonum == 1) {
			selectplace = weap22 - 11f;	
		}else if(p2Shoot.ammonum == 2) {
			selectplace = weap32 - 11f;	
		}else if(p2Shoot.ammonum == 3) {
		
		
		
{% highlight ruby %}
def foo
  puts 'foo'
end
{% endhighlight %}

It's an immensely useful tool and one we encourage you to use here with Hyde.
