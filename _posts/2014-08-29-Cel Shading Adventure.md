title: EVERYTHING GETS A CEL SHADER
---

So I think I'm about to get obsessed with cel shading. I like the look of it. I started by googling "unity cel shader" and getting crap results. Then, after several hours, I found out Unity has a built-in cel shader. Fucking everything in the world.

I'm starting to become a big fan of fast, messy prototypes composed largely of things other people have made. I guess I just like to see something working before I put in any serious effort. Here's my current mess:

Unity's stock 3rd person controller, some random "Alice" prefab I found, and terrain that I'm taking so seriously that I used Alice's body texture as the texture for it. I just wanted to see how a game would look if I cel shaded the fuck out of everything. So far, I'm in favor.

In general, I've been focusing on character models. I came across this character creation tool called UMA that seems like it's going for realism:

Definitely some uncanny valley stuff going on there. I have nothing but respect for the guy or girl that coded this, because I wouldn't even know where to begin, but those are some awkward looking character models. I've decided to stray away from realism and move more towards cartoonish models. Cartoonish models have the advantage of being so simple that creating and editing them is relatively painless.

I did mess with voxels, for about 30 total minutes. I think I've lost my passion for them. I feel like there was a voxel feeding frenzy for a few years, and now we're reaching a point of stability where everything interesting that could be done with them has been done. I doubt I'll change the world if I start working with them. A friend of mine this Summer wrote on the whiteboard in our game lab "Because you'll never pull a Notch." I believe he was right.

Here's an infinite-world voxel generator during one of my my Google adventures:

Beutiful, yes, but boring as a dog's ass. Even a cel shader couldn't make this interesting, and that's saying something. Voxel projects also appear quite grueling in the code department. At least the good voxel projects.

The next step for me is probably more of this 3D cartoony cel shaded stuff. When I get burned out on that, I plan to go back to my gravity project. I think I found a way to turn it into an actual game.
