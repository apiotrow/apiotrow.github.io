title: Game Pitch #1
---

Had to flex my game design skills and create a 2-minute game pitch. First major assignment in this Game Design Studio senior project course at my school. I tried to make my pitch programming-centric by building it off of my <a href="https://rawgit.com/apiotrow/UnityExperiments/master/gravity1.2/gravity1.2.html">Orbit Experiment</a>. Inspired by the non-competitive, chill, veg-out game called Flower,

I pitched a game where you begin as an electron directly after the big bang, and work your way up in complexity, becoming an atom, a molecule, a macromolecule, a planet, star, solar system, galaxy, ..., universe, or something. I thought it was pretty cool. But perhaps it was hubris (foreshadowing). I brought out the big guns for this one, and made a 20-second-or-so gameplay video. You know, to really bring this pitch to the next level. Here's the results:

The humor went over well, but the game wasn't selected. I'm proud of the quality of my pitch. I rehearsed it, refined it, and polished into a solid 2-minute explication. I suspect the game was too simple, though, and maybe too derivitave. It's something I still have to mull over for pitches #2 and #3, which we will be presenting over the next three weeks.

As for the direction, games that use custom hardware seemed to have an edge. A sky-diving simulation made the cut. This slide from their presentation still makes me laugh:
