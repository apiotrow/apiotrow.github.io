title: I got greenlit?
---

Pitched my <a href="https://rawgit.com/apiotrow/Alice/master/Assets/Executables/Alice1.2/Alice1.2.html">Alice</a> game for pitch #2. At around 3 AM the night prior to the pitch date, I realized I had nothing I was satisfied with. I decided to return to my Alice game at that point, and try to form a pitch for it. About half of the pitch ended up being "storyline." Eew. I fell on my crutch of humor, just to make the pitch more bearable. I got the laughs, and people were impressed with prototype, but the rest was just yuck. From what I heard, the last 10 seconds of this video swayed people in my favor:

I was invited to bring the game back for our "second chance" pitches, where we re-pitch something we felt was passed over. I think I'll pass, though. Plus, who needs a re-pitch when you got a motherfucking GREENLIGHT already?! Well, not a greenlight, technically. We keep calling it that, but it's a group of 45 pitches, out of the 320 total pitches, that will get to move on to the second round. My pitch #3 was one that got selected. Here's the pitch in it's entirety. I sought to minimize the text on the slides, as per suggestions I got on my previous pitches. As a result, the imagery to follow should do a fine job on its own of conveying just what a travesty this game idea is:

Have you ever seen a bigger load of shit in your life? This idea sounded plausible for the first 5 minutes I was thinking of it, then soon became the worst idea ever, for various reasons. But, out of sheer hilarity at the thought of pitching this, I went through with it. I was a good student, though. I did my research beforehand to see if anything like this already existed. I think perhaps there was a reason (or a few) that, no, in fact, nothing like this exists. However, I did find a thread on /r/Oculus from a year ago where someone proposed this idea, and got some solid feedback:

There's a few other concerns, such as the ones expressed in the class feedback Google doc:

Harsh. However, having my pitch selected means I have to refine it, build a prototype, and then pitch it again. The good part is that I can bring one classmate on to help me. I knew from the beginning who I wanted. I have a friend who has made it clear that he hates any kind of custom hardware, and is only interested in programming a game. I joked with him that if Hoppity-Boing made it to the final 15, I'd force him to join my team and make him work on the trampoline the entire year. I broke the bad new to him soon after I heard I was going on to round 2:
