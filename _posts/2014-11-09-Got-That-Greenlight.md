title: I got greenlit?
---

Pitched my <a href="https://rawgit.com/apiotrow/Alice/master/Assets/Executables/Alice1.2/Alice1.2.html">Alice</a> game for pitch #2. At around 3 AM the night prior to the pitch date, I realized I had nothing I was satisfied with. I decided to return to my Alice game at that point, and try to form a pitch for it. About half of the pitch ended up being "storyline." Eew. I fell on my crutch of humor, just to make the pitch more bearable. I got the laughs, and people were impressed with prototype, but the rest was just yuck. From what I heard, the last 10 seconds of this video swayed people in my favor:

I was invited to bring the game back for our "second chance" pitches, where we re-pitch something we felt was passed over. I think I'll pass, though. Plus, who needs a re-pitch when you got a motherfucking GREENLIGHT already?! Well, not a greenlight, technically. We keep calling it that, but it's a group of 45 pitches, out of the 320 total pitches, that will get to move on to the second round. My pitch #3 was one that got selected.
