<p>Messed around as much as I could with Unity’s built-in image effects. Once I found the <a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/script-EdgeDetectEffectNormals.html">Edge Detect Effect Normals</a> filter and saw it’s effects, I figured this would be a good time to make a game where there are two cameras side by side, each one corresponding to the left and right eye, and make them view the world in different ways. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateralization_of_brain_function">Lateralization of Brain Function</a> is a fun fact of the brain that pop-psychology has fallen in love with in the past few years. The left hemisphere is mathematical and logical, the right hemisphere is creative and artsy.</p>

<p>The right hemisphere actually controls the left side of the body, and vice versa, so I reversed the left-right split. Scientific accuracy and realism are very important principles in this simulation, as you can clearly see.</p>

<p>The right camera is using only the edge detect script, with one important variable maxed out to the point where everything is whited out except for edges, while the left camera is using just about every other filter in existence. Namely, <a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/script-GlowEffect.html">Glow Effects</a>,  <a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/script-NoiseAndGrain.html">Noise and Grain</a>,  <a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/script-SunShafts.html">Sun Shafts</a>, and  <a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/script-Vignetting.html">Vignetting</a>. I also experimented with <a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/script-CameraMotionBlur.html">Camera Motion Blur</a>, <a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/script-Bloom.html">Bloom</a>, and a few others, but they were either redundant or wonky.</p>

<p>I also played with camera culling to make certain objects only viewable with one eye. Not sure how a game would actually use this. The challenge would be something like, “How quickly can you dart your eyes back and forth? Are you man enough to shift your focus between two screens rapidly? Do you have what it takes notice differences? Try Left-And-Right Brain Simulator and find out… if you’ve got the balls.”</p>

<p>I’m pretty sure this would sell out in seconds. </p>
