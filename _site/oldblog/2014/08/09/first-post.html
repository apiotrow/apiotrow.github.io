<p>Skyboxes are these cool things in Unity that allow you to create skies. Skyboxes look a lot the inner faces of a cube, but they’re different in that you can’t reach them in-game. Professionally done skyboxes are usually high-res, use a bit of warping, and are tiled perfectly so that you can’t see any seams. When you pan around in a 3D environment with a skybox, it does give the impression of a sky. If you don’t want to use someone else’s work, you can create your own skybox. All you need is Unity, an image, an image editor, and the ability to divide by 4. Here’s a short tutorial:</p>

<p>Step 1: Find your picture</p>

<p>Step 2: Crop it 4 times</p>

<p>Step 3: Put it in Unity</p>
