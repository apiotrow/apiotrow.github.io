                I'm Aaron. I just graduated from University of California, Santa Cruz with a B.S. in Computer Science: Computer Game Design. It's essentially a computer science degree, where 25% of the classes focus specifically on game programming. Aside from that, it's a traditional CS degree.<br><br>
                
                What I've learned about myself is that my favorite problems are ones that don't have an obvious answers. I've also found that I like it when a simple feature unexpectedly ends up requiring an inordinately complex solution, yet also when a complex feature ends up requiring a very simple solution. The second one is probably the root of my interest in procedural generation. The first one is some form of masochism that I don't fully understand. I also like things that are funny but you can't pinpoint why.<Br><br>
                
                Anyway, I'm looking for a full-time gig, so check out my portfolio and <a href="assets/docs/resume.pdf">resume</a>. Hopefully you'll get a good gauge on whether I'm a fit for whatever you're working on. I look at my dive into the industry as an opportunity to be molded by those more experienced than me, and to contribute to others by devoting my time to things we're all excited about.

                <p>A Room Too Far is a 4-player cooperative dungeon crawler on an arcade machine, where players work together to defeat user-generated dungeons created via a level editor on our website. It's my senior project in the Computer Science: Computer Game Design major, being developed by a 9-person programming team and a slew of artists and other contributors. My main role has been the design and implementation of the front-end side of the level editor. My other tasks include the UI functionality across much the game, and a few chunks of the gameplay side, including the loot system, camera system, and some game feel features.</p>

Experimented with rope simulation (via a joint system), breakaway parts, events, and navigation systems.</p>

Players have destruction and construction weapons, which are used to alternately destroy and construct terrain in various patterns, as well as to hurt the other player. The voxel framework was coded using <a href="http://studentgamedev.blogspot.com/2013/08/unity-voxel-tutorial-part-1-generating.html">this online tutorial</a>. Gained experienced with animation timing, minimap functionality, and, of course, voxel systems. Using what I learned about them, I later created my own rhombic dodecahedral voxel system, which can be seen in the <a href="index.html#otherprojects">Other Projects</a> section.</p>

                <p>Created mainly as a joke to make my friends laugh, this is Sonic the Hedgehog-themed, nostalgia-inducing multiplayer experience. Using a networking framework called Photon and a large amount of assets ripped from classic console games, I implemented a pseudo-MMO (pseudo because there's no server storing player data). Despite being a joke project, I ended up learning a lot about multiplayer networking from it, and the fundamental differences between coding for a single-player game, and coding for a multiplayer online game. Programming challenges included creating a chat system, syncing each player's game world via RPCs, and storing player data (in this case, in the host's client).</p>

The project uses an injection program called BWAPI, which allows custom scripts to modify unit behavior in-game. Our code causes 3 Terran Vultures to disable a large Zerg base using kiting tactics. The vultures perform checks around themselves and either attack or flee, depending on the density of zerglings nearby, and the availability of escape routes.</p>

                <p>Created a system that can generate fractals using an L-system at runtime. The algorithm uses a depth-first strategy to generate the fractal in chunks and then render the chunks in sequence, avoiding the problem of generating large fractals all at once, which can take up to several minutes. The initial intent was to make a game where the environments are fractal in nature, as seen in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsuYZg8k-Zc">videos like this</a>. The next step in this project will either be adding a 3rd dimension in order to create a 3D fractal world, or attempting to turn this into a 2D infinite runner where an ever-generating fractal is the ground.</p>

If a follower collides with another, it does a speed check, changing its leader to who it collided with if it's moving slower than it. This eventually creates a serpent-like shape in the swarm. Different combinations of checks and behaviors lead to various other interesting swarm shapes.

                <p>Project made in an Android programming class. It's a workout assistant for gym-goers. My major contribution was a script that uses the inbuilt accelerometer to detect reptitions of an exercise, so the user can strap the phone to one of their limbs, press start, and let the app count reps for them.</p>

                <p>Implementation of a data scraper/data visualization for the <a href=https://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp_search.cgi>Erowid Experience Vaults</a>, a site with around 23,000 drug experience reports. The scraping tool programmatically performs searches of the Erowid database, collects the required data, and outputs it to a CSV. The project was born out of my interest in psychedelics, and my desire to make use of this massive and information-rich database. I ended up bringing the half-complete scraper to my data visualization class, where I completed it, and where my team and I created a visualization for the data. The next step will be implementing a new visualization. Watch the scraper in action with the Scraper Tool link above. </p>

                <p>Created a voxel system that tesselates rhombic dodecahedrons instead of cubes, creating a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhombic_dodecahedral_honeycomb">rhombic dodecahedral honeycomb</a>. Each solid is manually generated with verts and tris. Faces inside the terrain are deleted so that the entire plot is a single airtight mesh. I chose rhombic dodecahedrons as the shape just to give myself to a tough problem to solve. In retrospect, it's about the worst shape for a voxel system. Walking on them looks painful.</p>
